# Simon & Speck Block Ciphers in VHDL

VHDL implementations of the [Simon and Speck] block ciphers. These are small ciphers designed by the [National Security Agency] for use in constrained hardware and software environments such as micro controllers or small ASICs/FPGAs.
The code provided is synthesizable VHDL-93 compatible code appropriate for use in FPGAs and ASICs. Developement and testing was done with Xilinx ISE and Vivado tools using ISim for verification. 

**WARNING** The following implementations are for reference/research/entertainment only and should not be considered 100% free of bugs or side channel vulnerabilities. Use in a production environment is discouraged.

##  Basic Usage ##
Simon and Speck work identically: simply declare and instantiate the modules into your design and specify what key/block combination you want to use. You will also need to specify the number of rounds cipher rounds but this can calculated for your using the Round_Count_Lookup() function within each ciphers constants package (Simon_Constants.vhd and Speck_Constants.vhd)
 
The ciphers have a simple operational flow that has two main sequences: Key Schedule and Encryption/Decryption

#### For Key Schedule Generation ####

1. Set your cipher key on the `KEY` input bus
2. Set the `CONTROL` to `b01` to start the generation process
3. The `BUSY`signal  will assert while the key schedule is processed
4. Once `BUSY` deasserts, the cipher engine is ready to encrypt and decrypt with your chosen key; `KEY` will remain unused unless you wish to change the cipher key

#### To encipher or decipher data ####

1. Set your plaintext (if encrypting) or ciphertext (if decrypting) on the `BLOCK_INPUT` input bus
2. Set the `CONTROL` to `b11` to begin encrypting or `b10` to decrypt
3. `BUSY` will assert while the cipher is processed
4. Once `BUSY` deasserts, your new ciphertext or plaintext is available on `BLOCK_OUTPUT`. This output remains until a new encryption/decryption operation is completed

#### Additional Function Notes: ####

* Once key schedule calculation completes for a particular key, the cipher engine will store that key schedule until a new key is processed
* `RST` hold the cipher in the a reset state that will not respond to inputs and outputs are undefined.
* When the cipher engine unused, `CONTROL` should be held at `b00`
* Encryption and Decryption Operations can be done back to back by simple holding CONTROL at `b10` or `b11` and changing `BLOCK_INPUT` anytime after `BUSY` is asserted
* No block cipher mode other than ECB are currently supported.

Declaration/Instantiation examples as well as functional timing diagrams for various operations are given below.

### Block and Key Size ###
All valid key and block sizes as described in the specification are supported as generics. Valid block and key sizes in bits are given below. Additionally, the number of clock cycles to process an encryption or decryption operation is given. Due to the design, this value matches the number of rounds each version of respective ciphers is designed to run.

| **block size** | **key sizes** | **clock cycles (simon)** | **clock cycles (speck)** |
|:--------------:|:-------------:|:------------------------:|:------------------------:|
|       32       |       64      |             32           |             22           |
|       48       |     72,96     |           36,36          |           22,23          |
|       64       |     96,128    |           42,44          |           26,27          |
|       96       |     96,144    |           52,54          |           28,29          |
|       128      |  128,192,256  |          68,69,72        |          32,33,34        |

If not supplied at initialization, both ciphers will default to 256-bit encryption keys and 128-bit block sizes. If the defaults are not used, it is recommended to specify both the key size and block explicitly. 

## Tests Benches ##

A basic testbench for each cipher is included in SIMON_CIPHER_TB.vhd and SPECK_CIPHER_TB.vhd. These exercise key generation, encryption, and decryption for all key/block size combinations using the official test vectors. These also serve as examples on instantiating the different cipher sizes. 

Waveform configuration files (.wcfg) are included for use under Xilinx ISim.
